        <br>Washington: US President Joe Biden mistakenly introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as his Russian foe Vladimir Putin at a NATO summit Thursday in a blunder just hours before a press conference that could decide the fate of his reelection bid
        -old quickly corrected himself, and Zelensky quipped that he was "better" than Putin, but the gaffe intensified concerns about Biden's mental acuity after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump two weeks ago.

        Washington:US President Joe Biden, under intense scrutiny over his mental fitness to serve, mistakenly referred to his Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday as "Vice President Trump."
        Biden, asked whether Harris could beat Donald Trump if he decided not to run again, said: "I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I did not think she was not qualified to be president."

The provisional answer key of CUET UG was released on July 7 and candidates were asked to raise objections by July 9. “After the last date for the draft key challenge, experts review the challenges and prepare the final key. It usually takes about a week or two for NTA to do all this and announce the results. However, NTA is working to announce the results as soon as possible,” 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>This year, NTA also announced that the Agency will conduct a retest for CUET UG candidates from July 15 to 19 if any grievance raised by students about the conduct of the exam is found correct. This announcement comes more than a month after the NTA got caught in controversies around the NEET UG 2024 result, which was released 10 days in advance of the scheduled date.

After a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, who is also the Water Resources Minister, Ministers from the Cauvery river basin area, and officials, he also said that an all-party meeting will be held on July 14 to decide on the state’s next course of action.

        Heightened cyclone activity in West Bengal over the past few years has wreaked havoc in the historic Shibpur Botanical Garden, uprooting thousands of trees, some of which are centuries old. However, garden officials are working to find techniques to save these giants – they say that nearly 400 are already re-established.

Cyclones Amphan (in May 2020), Yaas (May 2021) and Remal (May 2024), had ripped more than 2100 big trees from the ground of Asia’s largest botanical garden of 109 hectares. As per data available with The Indian Express, 2000 plants were uprooted in Cyclone Amphan, 70 during Yaas and 100 during Remal.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>“Shallow roots due to West Bengal’s high water table leave trees vulnerable during cyclones,” said Dr. Devendra Singh, Joint Director of Shibipur’s Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden. Officials are now considering adding more soil to the surface, which would raise the ground level by 2-3 feet. This could significantly reduce uprooting during future storms, they believe.

        Scientists have designed a spacesuit that can recycle urine into drinking water to help astronauts execute lengthy spacewalks. The prototype has been inspired by full body “stillsuits”, seen in the science-fiction series Dune, which absorbed body’s moisture through sweating and urination, and purified it to turn it into drinking water. The water could be consumed through a tube attached to an individual’s neck, enabling them to survive in the open desert for weeks.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>“I have been a fan of the Dune series for as long as I can remember,” Sofia Etlin, a space medicine and policy researcher at Cornell University and co-designer of the new spacesuit, told Science News. “Building a real life stillsuit was always a bit of a dream.”

        The spacesuit’s design was published by the journal Frontiers in Space Technology on Friday (July 12).

                Astronauts also have issues with the maximum absorbency garment (MAG) — a waste management system which has been in use in spacesuits since the 1970s. There have been complaints about a lack of comfort and hygiene. Some have complained about contracting urinary tract infections (UTIs) because of MAG, which is essentially an adult diaper.
                    
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>The current spacesuits comprise bags which can handle only up to one litre of water. This limits astronauts from going on longer-lasting lunar spacewalks, which can last 10 hours, and even up to 24 hours in an emergency, Etlin told The Guardian.

        A panel framing rules for Uttarakhand’s Uniform Civil Code is trying to ensure that data provided by live-in couples remains protected but feels that information about those aged between 18 and 21 should be given to their parents, the committee’s chief said Friday.

The UCC, passed by the Uttarakhand Assembly in February, makes registration of live-in relationships and marriages mandatory.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>On Friday, the report of an expert committee on UCC was uploaded on the website http://www.ucc.uk.gov.in. Chairman of the UCC’s rules-making and implementation committee, Shatrughna Singh, said it could not be made public earlier because the model code of conduct was in force.

                The panel framing rules for the implementation of UCC will ensure there is no breach of privacy of data provided by people at the time of registering their marriages and live-in relationships, he said at a press conference here.
                Asked whether the mandatory provision of informing the parents about a live-in couple aged between 18 and 21 years would not be an assault on their privacy, Singh, who was formerly the chief secretary of Uttarakhand, said it was debatable
                    
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>“Data of live-in couples above 21 years of age will be totally protected. But, for couples aged between 18 and 21 years, the committee was of the view that the age (despite the fact that they have voting rights) is tender and so the parents should also be kept in the loop by way of precaution for the safety of the couple,” he said.

        The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Delhi Police not to harass a city resident who has filed a contempt plea against the DDA over “illegal” tree-felling in the Ridge forest.

A bench of justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan issued notice on the plea filed by the petitioner alleging harassment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>“We make it clear for all the authorities that no one will make any attempt to cause harassment to the petitioner only because she has filed a contempt petition and brought to the notice of this court about a breach of orders of this court,” the bench said.

                    Police in Hopkinton, R.I., twice denied Joseph Francis' applications to buy firearms because of a cyberstalking charge. But Francis' lawyer, who is also the president of the R.I. Second Amendment Coalition, cleared the way.

                <br>Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the petitioner, had informed the court that city police officers have been making inquiries regarding the other petitioner, New Delhi Nature Society, as well.

                Sankaranarayanan had claimed the police had also approached their bank and sought detailed information about their accounts.
